	<h1> Our Story </h1>
	<p>
		DBCLoomio was born on day 1 of final projects week when our team – Julia, Ben, Amrita, and Tracey – realized that the very basic functionality of a CRUD app would take up entire the week, preventing us from focusing on data visualization technology and other more advanced aspects of working in large code bases. Julia, our team lead, had the idea of making an app similar to Loomio that would help groups make efficient decisions. After discussing how to incorporate our desire to learn data visualization technology, we conconcluded that we would integrate D3 technology into Loomio’s existing functionality, allowing users to see images of the voting process through data visualization.
	</p>
	<p>
		We customized Loomio for DBC so that DBC will not only make more efficient decisions (the purpose of Loomio’s app), but we can also track member participation in those decisions. To track how decisions were made and by whom, the team decided to add demographic data to the users’ profiles. With the demographic data and data visualization technology in place, users are now able to view graphic representations of how members participated in each discussion topic juxtaposed against the gender, age, and race of the members.
	</p>
	<p>
		With these data visualizations, DBC (and other organizations) will be able to measure participation in the decision-making process by the demographics of the organization. For example, you can quickly identify aggregations of voters around any given discussion by gender, race, and age. Having this information in a clear and measurable format gives DBC a tool to increase diversity as well as make sure that member participation in the organization and its key decisions is shared equally among the many groups represented in our community.
	</p>

		The most difficult aspect of the project was learning to read and function in an enormous, existing, legacy codebase. We spent most of our time trying to understand what became known as “the Loch Ness,” Loomio’s huge, decoupled code base, which has been running migrations for five years. Virtually any small change resulted in hours of errors and debugging. Ultimately, we became familiar enough with the code base to not only add our own features, but also to contribute to Loomio’s open source issues posted on Github. We communicated with Loomio developers about what junior developers could contribute, then Julia and Ben  completed some of Loomio’s requests, including providing Loomio with Slack integration. A pull request is currently open and, according to recent communications with Loomio, will likely be accepted soon. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After becoming open source contributors, our team also received an email from a developer bootcamp in France letting us know that they used our Loomio pull request as an example to their students of how to submit pull requests and contribute to open source code on Github as junior developers.
